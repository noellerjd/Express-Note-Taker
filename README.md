# Note-Taker

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to work on creating a way to more easily read notes.

I built this project so that, in the end, the user would be able to push their own notes and later pull them back up in a visually pleasing way.

This is looking to solve a problem I sometimes face while writing notes, when I go back to read them sometimes it takes forever when looking through my own notebook so having something I can put my notes into digitally really would help.

I learned a lot about both post and get requests working on this project.

## Installation

In order to install my project you will need to download the repository to a folder, then in a terminal navigate to the folder containing the repository. Afterwards, run 'npm i' in the terminal and that should handle a majority of setup.

## Usage

Assuming the node modules are all setup, one should only have to run 'node server.js' in the terminal to get the server started. Then they can easily find localhost:3001 using any web browser to access the project.
